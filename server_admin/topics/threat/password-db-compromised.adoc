=== Password database compromised

{project_name} does not store passwords in raw text.
It stores a hash of them using the PBKDF2 algorithm.  It actually uses
a default of 20,000 hashing iterations!  This is the security community's recommended number of iterations.
This can be a rather large performance hit on your system as PBKDF2, by design, gobbles up a significant amount of CPU.
It is up to you to decide how serious you want to be to protect your password database.
