== Managing Clients

Clients are entities that can request authentication of a user.  Clients come in two forms.
The first type of client is an application that wants
to participate in single-sign-on.  These clients just want {project_name} to provide security for them.  The other type
of client is one that is requesting an access token so that it can invoke other services on behalf of the authenticated user.
This section discusses various aspects around configuring clients and various ways to do it.
