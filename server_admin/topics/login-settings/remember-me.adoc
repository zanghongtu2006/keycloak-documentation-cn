=== Remember Me

If a logged in user closes their browser, their session is destroyed and they will have to log in again.  You can set things
up so that if a user checks a _remember me_ checkbox, they will remain logged in even if the browser is closed.  This basically
turns the login cookie from a session-only cookie to a persistence cookie.

To enable this feature go to `Realm Settings` left menu item and click on the `Login` tab and turn on the `Remember Me` switch:

.Login Tab

Once you save this setting, a `remember me` checkbox will be displayed on the realm's login page.
