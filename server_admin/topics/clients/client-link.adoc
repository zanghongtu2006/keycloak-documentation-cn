=== Client Links

For scenarios where one wants to link from one client to another, {project_name} provides a special redirect endpoint: `/realms/realm_name/clients/\{client-id}/redirect`.

If a client accesses this endpoint via an `HTTP GET` request, {project_name} returns the configured base URL for the provided Client and Realm in the form of an `HTTP 307` (Temporary Redirect) via the response's `Location` header.

Thus, a client only needs to know the Realm name and the Client ID in order to link to them.
This indirection helps avoid hard-coding client base URLs. 

As an example, given the realm `master` and the client-id `account`:

http://host:port/auth/realms/master/clients/account/redirect
----               
Would temporarily redirect to: http://host:port/auth/realms/master/account
