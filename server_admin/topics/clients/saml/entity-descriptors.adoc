==== SAML Entity Descriptors

Instead of manually registering a SAML 2.0 client, you can import it via a standard SAML Entity Descriptor XML file.
There is an `Import` option on the Add Client page.

.Add Client

Click the `Select File` button and load your entity descriptor file.  You should review all the information there to make sure everything is set up correctly.

Some SAML client adapters like _mod-auth-mellon_ need the XML Entity Descriptor for the IDP.  You can obtain this by
going to this public URL:  `root/auth/realms/{realm}/protocol/saml/descriptor`
