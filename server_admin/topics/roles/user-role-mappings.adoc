=== User Role Mappings

User role mappings can be assigned individually to each user through the `Role Mappings` tab for that single user.

In the above example, we are about to assign the composite role `developer` that was created in the <<_composite-roles, Composite Roles>>
chapter.

.Effective Role Mappings

Once the `developer` role is assigned, you see that the `employee` role that is associated with the `developer` composite shows up in the `Effective Roles`.
`Effective Roles` are all roles that are explicitly assigned to the user as well as any roles that are inherited from composites.
