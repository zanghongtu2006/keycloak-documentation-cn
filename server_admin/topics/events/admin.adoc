=== Admin Events

Any action an admin performs within the admin console can be recorded for auditing purposes.
The Admin Console performs administrative functions by invoking on the {project_name} REST interface.  {project_name}
audits these REST invocations.  The resulting events can then be viewed in the Admin Console.

To enable auditing of Admin actions, go to the `Events` left menu item and select the `Config` tab.

In the `Admin Events Settings` section, turn on the `Save Events` switch.

The `Include Representation` switch will include any JSON document that is sent through the admin REST API.  This allows you to view exactly what an admin has done, but can lead to a lot of information stored in the
database.  The `Clear admin events` button allows you to wipe out the current information stored.

To view the admin events go to the `Admin Events` tab.

If the `Details` column has a `Representation` box, you can click on that to view the JSON that was sent with that operation.
