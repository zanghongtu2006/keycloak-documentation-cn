==== Internationalization

Every UI screen is internationalized in {project_name}.  The default language is English, but if you turn on the
`Internationalization` switch on the `Theme` tab you can choose which locales you want to support and what the default locale
will be.  The next time a user logs in, they will be able to choose a language on the login page to use for the login screens,
User Account Management UI, and Admin Console.  The link:{developerguide_link}[{developerguide_name}] explains
how you can offer additional languages.
