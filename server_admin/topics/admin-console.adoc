The left drop down menu allows you to pick a realm you want to manage or to create a new one.  The right drop down menu allows you to view your user account or logout.
If you are curious about a certain feature, button, or field within the Admin Console, simply hover your mouse
over any question mark `?` icon.  This will pop up tooltip text to describe the area of the console you are interested in.
The image above shows the tooltip in action.
