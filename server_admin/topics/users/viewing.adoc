=== Searching For Users

If you need to manage a specific user, click on `Users` in the left menu bar.

.Users
image:{project_images}/users.png[]

This menu option brings you to the user list page.  In the search box you can type in a full name, last name, or email address
you want to search for in the user database.  The query will bring up all users that match your criteria.  The `View all users` button
will list every user in the system.  This will search just local {project_name} database and not the federated database (ie. LDAP)
because some backends like LDAP don't have a way to page through users. So if you want the users from federated backend to be synced into {project_name}
database you need to either:

* Adjust search criteria. That will sync just the backend users matching the criteria into {project_name} database.
* Go to `User Federation` tab and click `Sync all users` or `Sync changed users` in the page with your federation provider.

See <<_user-storage-federation,User Federation>> for more details.
